Predict the result of URF games!

## How to use
The data folder contains scripts to get data from URF games and export them in the desired format.
* get_matches.js gets matches and stores them into a mongo db
* arff_matches.js exports these matches to a csv file with our desired format
* the other files are just for testing or saving some data

The main project (the website) is started with the command npm start
